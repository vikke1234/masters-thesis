abstract = {The role of CMOS Image Sensors since their birth around the 1960s, has been changing a lot. Unlike the past, current CMOS Image Sensors are becoming competitive with regard to Charged Couple Device (CCD) technology. They offer many advantages with respect to CCD, such as lower power consumption, lower voltage operation, on-chip functionality and lower cost. Nevertheless, they are still too noisy and less sensitive than CCDs. Noise and sensitivity are the key-factors to compete with industrial and scientific CCDs. It must be pointed out also that there are several kinds of CMOS Image sensors, each of them to satisfy the huge demand in different areas, such as Digital photography, industrial vision, medical and space applications, electrostatic sensing, automotive, instrumentation and 3D vision systems. In the wake of that, a lot of research has been carried out, focusing on problems to be solved such as sensitivity, noise, power consumption, voltage operation, speed imaging and dynamic range. In this paper, CMOS Image Sensors are reviewed, providing information on the latest advances achieved, their applications, the new challenges and their limitations. In conclusion, the State-of-the-art of CMOS Image Sensors.}

  abstract = {Single image super-resolution (SISR) is a notoriously challenging ill-posed problem that aims to obtain a high-resolution output from one of its low-resolution versions. Recently, powerful deep learning algorithms have been applied to SISR and have achieved state-of-the-art performance. In this survey, we review representative deep learning-based SISR methods and group them into two categories according to their contributions to two essential aspects of SISR: The exploration of efficient neural network architectures for SISR and the development of effective optimization objectives for deep SISR learning. For each category, a baseline is first established, and several critical limitations of the baseline are summarized. Then, representative works on overcoming these limitations are presented based on their original content, as well as our critical exposition and analyses, and relevant comparisons are conducted from a variety of perspectives. Finally, we conclude this review with some current challenges and future trends in SISR that leverage deep learning algorithms.},
