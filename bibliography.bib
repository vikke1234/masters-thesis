abstract = {The role of CMOS Image Sensors since their birth around the 1960s, has been changing a lot. Unlike the past, current CMOS Image Sensors are becoming competitive with regard to Charged Couple Device (CCD) technology. They offer many advantages with respect to CCD, such as lower power consumption, lower voltage operation, on-chip functionality and lower cost. Nevertheless, they are still too noisy and less sensitive than CCDs. Noise and sensitivity are the key-factors to compete with industrial and scientific CCDs. It must be pointed out also that there are several kinds of CMOS Image sensors, each of them to satisfy the huge demand in different areas, such as Digital photography, industrial vision, medical and space applications, electrostatic sensing, automotive, instrumentation and 3D vision systems. In the wake of that, a lot of research has been carried out, focusing on problems to be solved such as sensitivity, noise, power consumption, voltage operation, speed imaging and dynamic range. In this paper, CMOS Image Sensors are reviewed, providing information on the latest advances achieved, their applications, the new challenges and their limitations. In conclusion, the State-of-the-art of CMOS Image Sensors.}
