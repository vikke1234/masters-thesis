With the rise of mobile phones, robotics, and small cameras in general,
computational photography has become significantly more important. Because
devices such as mobile phones have such small apertures, the camera does not
receive enough light. This makes images dark and blurry, computational
photography has had a significant effect in the quality of the images these
cameras capture. One approach for low light photography on mobile devices is
to use burst photography and combine multiple images into a single one. These
use cases will be covered in a later chapter in detail.

Cameras today are very advanced pieces of hardware, with a long and complex
pipeline from the sensor to the application. \cref{section:background} will
give an overview of what happens after the sensor captures an image.
