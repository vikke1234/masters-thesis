\textit{Views expressed in this thesis are my own and do not represent anyone else.}

With the rise of mobile phones, robotics, and small cameras in general,
computational photography has become significantly more important. Because
devices such as mobile phones have such small apertures, the camera does not
receive enough light. This makes images dark and blurry, computational
photography has had a significant effect in the quality of the images these
cameras capture. One approach for low light photography on mobile devices is
to use burst photography and combine multiple images into a single one. These
use cases will be covered in a later chapter in detail.

Cameras today are very advanced pieces of hardware, with a long and complex
pipeline from the sensor to the application. Though the field itself is very
secretive, few manufacturers of either the camera sensor or the processing
chips disclose how their hardware works. Reverse engineering is very
cumbersome, especially in hardware. Few companies will say what their hardware
does because they are often violating each others patents
\cite{experimentalCompPhot}, if you do not say what you do; you can not be sued.
This increases the secrecy in the field, given these constraints there are few
texts that will give an comprehensive view into the field. This thesis aims to
give an overview of what each part of a camera system does and give a brief
introduction into cameras.

In addition to hardware and software advancement, \textit{Artificial Intelligence} (AI)
has become very common to tackle problems in for example super resolution
\cite{yangDeepLearningSingle2019} \cite{delbracio2021mobile}. Where deep
learning etc. have been used. This thesis will not cover AI uses that deeply
only giving a brief overview of what has been done, instead we will have a
focus on automotive, mobile, and hardware.

We will cover sensors, image signal processors,
camera APIs, and finally some uses.
