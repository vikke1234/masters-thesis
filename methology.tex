\chapter{Methodology}
\section{Introduction}
This chapter gives an overview of how the research was conducted on
computational photography. This thesis aims to give an overview of the field,
giving a background into various hardware that a camera uses. How these
cameras can be programmed, and finally we will go over recent trends in the
field.

The methodology is to answer the following questions: How do ISPs work to
enhance images? How do sensors work? What role do camera APIs have? What
are issues currently faced when trying to use cameras? What are current trends
in the field?

\section{Data collection}
\subsection{Methods}
Based on earlier expertise, data is collected in various ways, the process
begins by looking at standards for various technologies. When comparing the APIs
the documentation of the APIs were studied and some experts were questioned.
Additionally some sample applications were provided.

Several interviews were also conducted, these were largely anonymized. The
position the person was in and which field will be mentioned. These interviews
were designed to get an understanding of what the pain points currently are
when programming cameras. We looked for potential interviewees on various
forums related to robotics, development, as well as asked various contacts in
related fields if they knew interested parties. The full text of interviews can
be found in \cref{appendix:interviews}, unless specifically mentioned that it
is not available due to request.

\subsection{Limitations}
This thesis tries to give a comprehensive view of everything, but due to the
nature of the field not everything is public information. The thesis can not
always give a detailed description of everything, especially when dealing with
hardware such as ISPs. Additionally we will only give a high level look into
what these do, details of the inner workings of these devices can be found in
the specification if it is available.
