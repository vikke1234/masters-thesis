# libcamera
libcamera is an open-source C++ camera framework that supports a large number
of complex cameras such as the IMX 219, 477 and many more. It supports multiple
encoders to receive images in for example PNGs/raw images.The primary target
for libcamera is Arm processors in the form of Raspberry PI's, Chrome OS and
Android though many other architectures are also supported.

Before libcamera, the way to use camera sensors was very complex, often
requiring it's own MCU. libcamera moved this almost completely to userspace,
trivializing many applications. libcamera supports a variety of Image Processing
Algorithms (IPA's) for the 3A (Auto focus, Auto gain, Auto white balancing).
