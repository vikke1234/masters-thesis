\chapter{Computational photography\label{discussion}}
In this chapter we aim to give an overview of the field itself, we cover recent
advancements in the field. How the previously mentioned APIs have been used
and a view into what the future will look like.

With the rise of fields like mobile phones, automotive, and robotics;
computational photography has become more important then ever. Due to size
constraints in many applications like mobile, the cameras themselves are often
not very good. To compensate this, different IPAs have been developed. These
IPAs allow for example the image to look much brighter, clearer, or in general
better.
