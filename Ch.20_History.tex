\chapter{History\label{history}}
This chapter will give a brief overview of the history of camera API's. In the
early days cameras were quite simple, there effectively was just the "press
button" followed by receiving a picture. This was the case with most cameras
such as webcams, even the integrated laptop ones were just USB devices. Linux
had initially had lacking support for this, but in the early 2000s Video For
Linux (V4L, later V4L2 for version 2) was developed. This covered most of the
use cases at the time. In 2008 the Nokia N900 was released, this was a Linux
based phone that was not like most cameras at the time. It provided interfaces
for customizing just about everything. From ISPs to Image Processing Algorithms
(IPA's).
